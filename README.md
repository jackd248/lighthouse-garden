## Installation

### Prerequisite

The script needs [python](https://python.org/) __3.5__ or higher. It is necessary for some additional functionalities to have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed on your local machine. 

<a name="install-pip"></a>

}
```

## Usage

Run the python script via command line.

```bash
$ python3 lighthouse_garden
```

```bash
usage: lighthouse_garden [-h] [-v] [-c CONFIG] [--clear]

### Cronjob

Register optionally a cronjob for regularly updates

```bash
0 5 * * * python3 lighthouse_garden -c /var/www/html/config.json
```

## Test

Run the script within the [DDEV](https://www.ddev.com/) container:

```bash
$ ddev start
$ ddev ssh
/var/www/html$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
/var/www/html$ python3 lighthouse_garden -c tests/config.json
```

Open `http://lighthouse-garden.ddev.site/`
